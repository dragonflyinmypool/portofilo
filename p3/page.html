<h2>Design 3, Projects 2</h2>
<h3>Design Challange</h3>
<p>Analyze a city block. Look at the space, movement, environment and other factors. Make an improvement to the city block, based on the analyzes. </p><h3>My Design </h3>
<p>I found that the interior of the block was being neglected, undervalued and could be put to better use. I created an internal green space that could be used for walking and movement. This space could also be connected to other similar blocks providing a valuable walking network through the city.</p>
